    "    - Beware of slow degradation too: models tend to \"rot\" as data evolves.   \n",
    "    - Measuring performance may require a human pipeline (e.g., via a crowdsourcing service).  \n",
    "    - Also monitor your inputs' quality (e.g., a malfunctioning sensor sending random values, or another team's output becoming stale). This is  particulary important for online learning systems.  \n",
    "3. Retrain your models on a regular basis on fresh data (automate as much as possible). "
